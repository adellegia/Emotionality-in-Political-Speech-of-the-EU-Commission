      "[Check against delivery] Today at the EPSCO Council, we are addressing issues which have a direct impact on citizens. Allow me to highlight them. During this morning's discussion, we touched on labour mobility. I confirmed that the Commission will tomorrow present a proposal for revision of the rules on posting of workers, aiming to ensure fair conditions for workers and a level playing field for companies. When preparing this proposal, I have listened carefully to the views of all Member States and all Social Partners. I believe this is a balanced proposal and I invite all to examine it with an open mind. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss this proposal with Ministers in more detail during our Informal Council meeting in Amsterdam next month. This afternoon I will inform Ministers of one of the headline initiatives of the Commission's work programme for this year, the European Pillar of Social Rights. The Commission will tomorrow adopt a Communication launching a broad consultation on the concept. This consultation will look into important questions: are our EU and Member State policies on social affairs in the broad sense of the word still up to date? Are they fit-for purpose for the 21st century? How can we make the European social model future-proof? How can we strive towards a better Europe for the next generation? For Europe to be successful in the future and – equally important – to remain credible for European citizens, we need to reinforce the social dimension of the European Union, particularly in the euro area. This is part of our efforts for a deeper and fairer Economic and Monetary Union and indeed to achieve a \"social triple A\" rating for Europe. This afternoon we will also have a policy debate with Ministers to help shape the New Skills Agenda for Europe which I will be putting forward in May. Our aim is to deliver skills for employability, ensuring that people have the skills they need to keep pace with a fast-changing labour market. To achieve this, we will need to create strong partnerships between education, training and labour market actors; all have their part to play. The need for action is clear; no less than 40% of employers say they can't find people with the right skills. I look forward to the input of the Employment Ministers to help shape the Commission's proposal.\n"
